# Lattice: A Content-Addressed Multi-Chain Proof-of-Work System

*Treehouse Labs*
*March 2026*

## Abstract

We propose a proof-of-work blockchain architecture where all data — blocks, transactions, and state — is stored in a content-addressed storage (CAS) layer, enabling a novel approach to multi-chain security and state management. The Nexus chain serves as a root of trust for an arbitrary tree of child chains, each inheriting the parent's proof-of-work security through merged mining at zero additional cost. State transitions are derived by structurally diffing merkle trees rather than replaying transactions, making state extraction correct by construction and independent of execution logic. Block propagation exploits the CAS layer: miners push full blocks to direct peers for availability, while relay peers announce only content identifiers, with downstream nodes reconstructing blocks from locally-cached transaction data. This combination of content-addressed storage, structural state diffing, and merged mining creates a system where adding new chains does not dilute security, state management is provably consistent, and network bandwidth scales sub-linearly with block size.

---

## 1. Introduction

The original Bitcoin design [1] demonstrated that a peer-to-peer network of nodes can agree on a total ordering of transactions using proof-of-work, without relying on trusted third parties. However, Bitcoin's single-chain architecture creates a fundamental tradeoff: all applications must compete for space on one chain, and building a new chain means building new security from scratch.

Existing approaches to this problem include sidechains [2], which require explicit trust assumptions for cross-chain transfers; rollups [3], which inherit parent chain security but require complex fraud or validity proofs; and proof-of-stake multi-chain systems [4], which sacrifice the permissionless nature of proof-of-work.

We present Lattice, a system that resolves this tension through three key ideas:

1. **Content-addressed merged mining.** A parent chain block may embed child chain blocks as content-addressed references. The parent's proof-of-work covers the entire tree, so child chains inherit full security with no additional mining. Adding a new child chain requires no changes to the mining process.

2. **Structural state diffing.** Rather than deriving state by replaying transactions, Lattice stores pre-execution and post-execution state roots in each block and computes state transitions by structurally diffing the merkle trees. This makes state extraction correct by construction, enables O(accounts) state rebuild after sync, and allows reorg recovery without transaction re-execution.

3. **CAS-first block propagation.** All blockchain data is content-addressed. Transactions gossiped through the mempool are stored locally by their content identifier. When a block is announced, receiving nodes reconstruct it from their local CAS, fetching only genuinely new data (coinbase, state roots) from the network. This reduces relay bandwidth by approximately 99% for transaction-heavy blocks.

4. **Incentivized content delivery.** The Ivy peer-to-peer layer introduces an economic model for data retrieval. Bilateral credit lines between peers enable fee-based DHT forwarding with pay-on-success semantics: requesters set a total fee budget, each relay hop deducts a relay fee, and the data provider keeps the remainder. Trust grows logarithmically with successful settlements, and proof-of-work mining doubles as settlement — miners pay off credit line debts with real work.

## 2. Content-Addressed Storage

### 2.1 Data Model

Every object in Lattice — blocks, transactions, state trees, chain specifications — is serialized to a deterministic canonical form and identified by its content hash (CID). The CID is computed as:

```
CID = encode(hash(serialize(object)))
```

where `serialize` uses sorted-key JSON encoding and `hash` produces a 256-bit digest. This means identical data always produces identical identifiers, regardless of when or where it was created.

### 2.2 Three-Tier Resolution

Objects are stored in a three-tier cache hierarchy:

- **Memory**: In-process LRU cache for hot data
- **Disk**: Persistent key-value store for local data
- **Network**: Peer-to-peer fetch via the Ivy protocol for missing data

When a CID is requested, the system checks each tier in order. This means data gossiped via the mempool (stored locally) is never re-fetched during block reconstruction — a property we exploit for bandwidth-efficient block propagation.

### 2.3 Merkle Data Structures

State is organized as merkle dictionaries — content-addressed key-value trees where each node's CID depends on its children. This provides two properties:

1. **Inclusion proofs.** A light client can verify that an account balance is correct by checking a logarithmic-sized proof against the state root in a block header.

2. **Structural diffing.** Given two state roots (before and after a block's transactions), the system can compute exactly which keys changed, were inserted, or were deleted, without knowledge of the transactions themselves.

---

## 3. Multi-Chain Architecture

### 3.1 The Nexus Chain

The Nexus chain is the root of the chain tree. It has its own state, transaction throughput, and economic parameters (block time, reward schedule, difficulty adjustment). Every Lattice node must validate the Nexus chain.

### 3.2 Child Chains

A child chain is a fully independent blockchain with its own:
- **Chain specification**: block time, reward, max transactions, state growth limits
- **State**: separate account balances, general state, and transaction history
- **Difficulty**: adjusted independently of the parent

Child chains are created by including a child genesis block inside a Nexus block's `childBlocks` field. Once discovered, nodes that subscribe to that child chain begin tracking its state.

### 3.3 Merged Mining

A Nexus block template includes a `childBlocks` field — a content-addressed dictionary mapping child chain identifiers to child block headers. When the miner finds a valid nonce for the Nexus block, all embedded child blocks are simultaneously "mined" at no additional cost.

The proof-of-work hash covers the entire block structure including child block CIDs:

```
hash_input = prevBlockCID || txCID || difficulty || ... || childBlocksCID || height || timestamp
valid iff difficulty >= hash(hash_input + nonce)
```

Since `childBlocksCID` is included in the hash input, the child blocks are immutably bound to the parent's proof-of-work. An attacker cannot modify a child block without invalidating the parent block's hash.

### 3.4 Security Analysis

A child chain inherits the full hashrate of the Nexus chain. To rewrite a child chain block at depth *d*, an attacker must rewrite the corresponding Nexus block, which requires controlling more than 50% of the network's total hashrate — the same security threshold as the Nexus chain itself.

This contrasts with independent PoW chains, where security is proportional to each chain's individual hashrate, and with federated sidechains, where security depends on the honesty of a fixed set of signers.

## 4. State Management

### 4.1 Dual State Representation

Each block contains two state roots:
- **Homestead**: the state root *before* the block's transactions are applied
- **Frontier**: the state root *after* the block's transactions are applied

Both are CIDs pointing into the merkle state tree. The homestead of block *N* equals the frontier of block *N-1*.

### 4.2 Structural State Diffing

To determine what changed in a block, the node structurally diffs the frontier and homestead merkle trees:

```
diff = frontier.accountState.diff(from: homestead.accountState)
diff.inserted  → new accounts created
diff.deleted   → accounts removed
diff.modified  → accounts whose balance changed (with old and new values)
```

This approach has three advantages over transaction replay:

1. **Correct by construction.** The diff captures every state change, including implicit changes from child chain operations that don't appear in transaction bodies.
2. **Execution-independent.** State changes can be extracted without understanding transaction semantics. This enables alternative node implementations to verify state without reimplementing the full execution engine.
3. **Efficient reorg recovery.** To roll back a block during a chain reorganization, the node inverts the diff (swapping old and new values). No transaction re-execution is required.

### 4.3 Path-Based State Storage

For query performance, current state is cached in a SQLite database indexed by path:

| Path | Value |
|------|-------|
| `account:<address>` | `{balance, nonce}` |
| `general:<key>` | arbitrary data |
| `meta:chain-tip` | current tip CID |

This provides O(1) balance lookups for RPC queries. The CAS merkle tree remains the source of truth; the path-based cache is rebuilt from the CAS frontier after sync.

### 4.4 State Rebuild After Sync

When a node syncs from a peer, it does not replay every block's transactions. Instead:

1. Resolve the tip block's frontier state root from the CAS
2. Recursively resolve the account state merkle dictionary
3. Enumerate all key-value pairs and write them to the path-based cache

This is O(total accounts) rather than O(total blocks × changes per block).

---

## 5. Block Propagation

### 5.1 The CAS Propagation Model

Traditional blockchain networks propagate full block data to every peer. In Lattice, transaction bodies are already distributed through mempool gossip and cached in each node's local CAS.

When a miner produces a block:

1. The full block tree (header, transactions, state) is stored in the miner's CAS
2. The miner pushes the full block to direct peers (ensuring immediate data availability)
3. Direct peers announce only the block CID to their peers
4. Downstream nodes resolve the block CID through their CAS — finding most transaction bodies already cached locally from prior mempool gossip
5. Only genuinely new data (coinbase transaction, state roots) is fetched from the network

### 5.2 Bandwidth Analysis

For a block containing *n* transactions where *p* fraction of those transactions were previously gossiped through the mempool:

- Traditional propagation: each relay transfers the full block (~*n* × *t* bytes, where *t* is average transaction size)
- CAS propagation (hop 2+): each relay transfers the block header + (1-*p*) × *n* × *t* bytes

In practice, *p* > 0.99 for blocks produced shortly after mempool propagation, yielding approximately 99% bandwidth reduction on relay hops.

## 6. Transaction Model

### 6.1 Account Actions

Lattice uses an explicit balance-change model rather than an opcode-based virtual machine. A transaction contains a list of `AccountAction` entries, each specifying:

- `owner`: the account address
- `oldBalance`: the account's current balance (verified against state)
- `newBalance`: the desired balance after this action

The node verifies that `oldBalance` matches the on-chain balance and that the conservation law holds across all actions:

```
sum(debits) = sum(credits) + fee
```

where a debit is `oldBalance - newBalance` for accounts whose balance decreases, and a credit is `newBalance - oldBalance` for accounts whose balance increases.

### 6.2 Atomic Swaps

Transactions may include `SwapAction` and `SwapClaimAction` entries for cross-account atomic swaps. These are validated as part of the same conservation check, ensuring atomicity without an intermediary.

### 6.3 MEV Protection

For the built-in decentralized exchange, a commit-reveal batch auction mechanism prevents miner front-running:

1. **Commit phase**: Users submit a hash of their order details plus a random salt
2. **Reveal phase**: After a 3-block waiting period, users reveal their actual order
3. **Settlement**: All revealed orders in a batch are matched simultaneously at midpoint prices

This eliminates the information advantage that miners would otherwise have from seeing pending orders in the mempool.

---

## 7. Consensus

### 7.1 Proof of Work

A block is valid when `difficulty >= hash(block_prefix + nonce)`, where the block prefix includes all block fields except the nonce. Miners search for valid nonces using parallel workers across CPU cores.

### 7.2 Heaviest Chain Rule

The canonical chain is the one with the most cumulative work, computed as:

```
work(block) = MAX_UINT256 / block.difficulty
cumulative_work(chain) = sum(work(block) for block in chain)
```

This ensures that the chain backed by the most total computational effort is selected, regardless of chain length.

### 7.3 Difficulty Adjustment

Difficulty adjusts on every block within a rolling window (default: 120 blocks). If blocks are produced faster than the target time (10 seconds for Nexus), difficulty increases; if slower, it decreases. The adjustment rate is bounded to prevent extreme oscillations.

### 7.4 Block Rewards

```
reward(height) = initialReward >> (height / halvingInterval)
```

With `initialReward = 1,048,576` and `halvingInterval = 315,576,000` (approximately 100 years at 10-second blocks), the reward halves roughly every century. The total supply converges to approximately 661 trillion tokens.

## 8. Network Protocol

### 8.1 Peer Discovery

Nodes discover peers through four mechanisms, in priority order:

1. **Persisted peers** from the previous session
2. **Bootstrap nodes** hardcoded in the binary
3. **DNS seeds** via TXT record lookups
4. **DHT discovery** via Kademlia queries (every 60 seconds)

### 8.2 Eclipse Attack Protection

To prevent an attacker from isolating a node by controlling all its peer connections:

- Maximum 2 outbound connections per /16 IPv4 subnet
- 2 "anchor peers" persisted across restarts
- Overrepresented subnets pruned during periodic peer refresh
- Peer reputation tracked via the Tally system, with automatic disconnection of misbehaving peers

### 8.3 Protocol Versioning

Each peer announcement includes a protocol version number, enabling coordinated network upgrades via height-activated forks. Nodes reject peers below the minimum supported protocol version.

---

## 9. Ivy Economic Layer

### 9.1 Bilateral Credit Lines

Each pair of directly connected peers maintains a bilateral credit line — an IOU tracking the net balance of data served vs. consumed. When peer A serves data to peer B, B's balance decreases (debt to A increases). Credit lines have a threshold that limits maximum debt; the threshold grows logarithmically with successful settlements, bootstrapping from a minimum trust derived from proof-of-work key difficulty (trailing zero bits of SHA-256 of the peer's public key).

### 9.2 Fee-Bid Model

Content retrieval uses a fee-bid model. The requester sets a total fee budget for a `dhtForward` request. Each relay node deducts a `relayFee` and forwards the remainder. The destination node (data provider) keeps whatever fee remains. This creates natural incentives: closer data is cheaper to retrieve, and popular data gets cached by relay nodes (who then serve it for the full fee on future requests).

### 9.3 Pay-on-Success

Fees are only charged when data successfully returns through the relay chain. If a request times out or the data isn't found, no credit line adjustment occurs. This eliminates griefing attacks where a peer could drain a neighbor's credit by sending unanswerable requests.

### 9.4 Pin Discovery

Nodes that store data publish pin announcements to the DHT, declaring which content identifiers they serve and under what selector paths. When a node needs data, it first discovers pinners via `findPins`, then sends targeted `dhtForward` requests routed toward the pinner's public key rather than the content hash — ensuring the request reaches the actual data holder.

### 9.5 Settlement via Mining

Credit line debts are settled through proof-of-work. When a node mines a block, the mining proof (nonce + block hash) is submitted to creditors as a settlement message. The creditor verifies the work meets the agreed difficulty and credits the debtor's balance. This means mining simultaneously secures the blockchain and services the economic layer — miners naturally earn credit with their peers.

## 10. Economics

### 10.1 Nexus Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Block time | 10 seconds |
| Initial reward | 1,048,576 tokens |
| Halving interval | ~100 years |
| Total supply | ~661 trillion tokens |
| Premine | ~10% |
| Max transactions/block | 5,000 |
| Max block size | 10 MB |

### 10.2 Child Chain Economics

Each child chain defines its own economic parameters — block time, reward schedule, halving interval — independent of the Nexus chain. This enables application-specific tokenomics while inheriting Nexus-level security.

### 10.3 Fee Market

Transactions include an explicit fee. Miners select transactions by fee descending, creating a fee market where users compete for block space. Replace-by-fee (RBF) allows users to increase the fee on a pending transaction by at least 10%.

## 11. Related Work

**Bitcoin** [1] introduced proof-of-work consensus and the UTXO transaction model. Lattice builds on Bitcoin's security model while replacing UTXOs with explicit balance changes and adding native multi-chain support.

**Ethereum** [5] introduced stateful accounts and a Turing-complete virtual machine. Lattice takes a simpler approach: explicit account actions rather than general computation, with state transitions derived from merkle diffs rather than VM execution.

**Namecoin** [6] pioneered merged mining, allowing a child chain to reuse the parent's proof-of-work. Lattice generalizes this to an arbitrary tree of child chains embedded directly in the parent block structure.

**IPFS/Filecoin** [7] demonstrated content-addressed storage for distributed systems. Lattice applies the same principle to blockchain data, using CIDs as the universal reference mechanism for blocks, transactions, and state. Unlike Filecoin's proof-of-storage consensus, Ivy's economic layer uses bilateral credit lines with pay-on-success fees — a lighter-weight approach that doesn't require on-chain storage proofs.

**Ethereum PBSS** [8] introduced path-based state storage to replace hash-based storage, reducing disk growth by an order of magnitude. Lattice adopts this pattern, using SQLite as a path-indexed cache over the CAS merkle trees.

## 12. Conclusion

Lattice demonstrates that content-addressed storage, when used as the foundational layer of a blockchain, enables a constellation of improvements to multi-chain security, state management, and network efficiency.

Merged mining through content-addressed child blocks provides a clean solution to the security fragmentation problem: new chains inherit full parent-chain security at zero marginal cost. Structural state diffing eliminates the need for transaction replay during state extraction, reorg recovery, and post-sync state rebuild. CAS-aware block propagation reduces relay bandwidth by approximately 99% by exploiting the fact that transaction data is already distributed via mempool gossip.

The Ivy economic layer completes the picture: nodes earn revenue by storing and serving data, credit lines enable trust to grow organically, and proof-of-work mining doubles as settlement — creating a self-sustaining network where every participant is incentivized to contribute storage, bandwidth, and computation.

The system is operational, with a reference implementation, 158 passing tests, and deployment tooling for Fly.io available at https://github.com/treehauslabs.
